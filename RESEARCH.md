# Probing LLMs for confidence: A comprehensive research roadmap

The field of uncertainty quantification in large language models has matured into a robust research area with **proven methods achieving 55% reductions in calibration error** and **6+ percentage point AUROC improvements** over baselines. Three major paradigms dominate current work: hidden state-based probing (extracting confidence from internal representations), consistency-based methods (measuring agreement across multiple outputs), and verbalized confidence (prompting models to express uncertainty). For an MIT deep learning project, the highest-impact opportunities lie at the intersection of mechanistic interpretability and uncertainty quantification—specifically developing **hierarchical multi-scale probing architectures**, **uncertainty-aware sparse autoencoders**, and **causal tracing of confidence circuits** through transformer layers. The research infrastructure is exceptionally mature, with open-source models like Llama 3.1, standardized benchmarks like MMLU and TriviaQA, and production-ready codebases enabling rapid prototyping.

## Foundation: Linear probes establish the baseline

Linear probing emerged as the foundational technique through John Hewitt and Christopher Manning's 2019 structural probes work, which demonstrated that syntax trees are embedded in neural representation geometry. The approach is elegantly simple: freeze a pre-trained LLM, extract hidden states from target layers, and train a lightweight linear classifier to predict whether outputs are correct. This simplicity offers critical advantages—**parameters typically number under 16,000** (versus millions for the base model), training completes in minutes rather than hours, and the risk of memorization remains low compared to complex neural architectures.

The technical implementation extracts hidden states using HuggingFace's `output_hidden_states=True` flag, typically focusing on the final token's representation for autoregressive models or the [CLS] token for encoder models. Recent work reveals that **middle layers (50-75% depth) consistently outperform final layers** for uncertainty estimation, contradicting initial intuitions that task-specific representations in late layers would be optimal. For Llama-2-7B, layer 16 of 32 shows peak performance; for larger models, testing layers at quartile positions (L/4, L/2, 3L/4, L-1) provides efficient coverage.

Training procedures employ standard supervised learning with binary cross-entropy loss, though recent innovations introduce confidence-weighted variants that penalize overconfident mistakes more heavily. Optimization typically uses Adam with learning rates between 1e-3 and 1e-4, with 10-50 epochs sufficient for convergence on datasets of 10,000+ examples. The critical validation step involves selectivity testing—training control probes on random labels to verify that performance stems from genuine feature extraction rather than spurious correlations.

## Beyond linearity: Non-linear probes and their trade-offs

While linear probes dominate due to interpretability, several research threads explore non-linear variants. Multi-layer perceptrons with 1-2 hidden layers (512-2048 units) achieve **5-10% accuracy improvements** over linear baselines, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. Jennifer White's 2021 work on kernelized structural probes demonstrated that syntactic knowledge partially encodes non-linearly, with RBF kernels providing statistically significant gains across six languages. The 2024 Polar Probe extends this further, achieving nearly 2-fold improvements by predicting both labeled and directed dependency trees through relative direction encoding.

Attention-based probes represent a more sophisticated architecture, applying multi-head attention mechanisms (typically 2-8 heads) to hidden states to identify which tokens contribute most to confidence estimates. These architectures excel at capturing sequential dependencies and token-level uncertainty dynamics. However, the parameter count explodes to 100k-1M, training requires 30-120 minutes, and memorization risks increase substantially. The consensus in recent literature suggests deploying non-linear probes only when linear approaches plateau and when sufficient data (50k+ samples) exists to constrain overfitting.

The layer selection question extends beyond identifying a single optimal layer. Ensemble approaches that aggregate predictions across multiple layers show consistent improvements, though computational costs scale linearly with layers probed. Dynamic layer selection—routing different query types to different optimal layers via learned gating mechanisms—remains largely unexplored but offers promising efficiency gains. Early experiments suggest **23.3% of layers suffice for equal performance** when oracle layer selection operates, indicating substantial room for optimization.

## Measuring what matters: Calibration and evaluation metrics

Expected Calibration Error (ECE) has emerged as the primary calibration metric, measuring the gap between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy. The calculation bins predictions (typically 10-20 bins), computes accuracy and average confidence per bin, then takes the weighted average of absolute differences. **Well-calibrated systems achieve ECE below 0.05** (5%), while baseline LLMs often exhibit ECE of 0.10-0.15. Recent methods like CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability) achieve remarkable calibration improvements, reducing ECE by up to **88% in some configurations**.

However, ECE alone provides incomplete assessment. The Brier score combines calibration and discrimination into a proper scoring rule, decomposing into reliability (calibration quality), resolution (separating positives from negatives), and inherent uncertainty. For binary predictions, Brier scores below 0.10 indicate strong performance, while scores above 0.30 suggest fundamental issues. AUROC (Area Under ROC Curve) measures discrimination quality independently of calibration, with values above 0.80 considered excellent and above 0.90 outstanding. State-of-the-art probing methods achieve **AUROC of 0.75-0.85 for hallucination detection** and **0.70-0.80 for general confidence estimation**.

Selective prediction metrics address practical deployment scenarios where models can abstain from answering. The Prediction-Rejection Ratio plots quality versus uncertainty threshold, measuring how accuracy improves as coverage decreases. Production systems targeting 90% accuracy might achieve 80-85% coverage with well-calibrated confidence estimates. Conformal prediction provides complementary guarantees, constructing prediction sets with statistical validity—ensuring that 90% coverage truly contains correct answers 90% of the time. Recent conformal methods for LLMs achieve these guarantees while minimizing prediction set sizes through sophisticated nonconformity measures.

## Implementation architecture: From extraction to inference

Extracting hidden states efficiently requires careful engineering. For a single forward pass on Llama-2-70B with 32k context, **hidden states consume approximately 20GB of memory** (batch_size × seq_len × hidden_dim × num_layers × 4 bytes). Production systems implement several optimizations: extract and cache embeddings to disk incrementally, use gradient checkpointing during probe training, process in smaller batches (16-64 samples), and employ mixed precision (float16/bfloat16) for 2x memory reduction.

The caching strategy proves critical for iterative experimentation. Memory-mapped arrays enable training on datasets exceeding RAM capacity, while preprocessing pipelines normalize embeddings and handle variable-length sequences through strategic padding and truncation. Token position selection—last token for autoregressive models, averaged representations for masked models—significantly impacts performance. Recent experiments demonstrate that **concatenating question and answer activations provides limited benefit**, suggesting the last token's activation sufficiently encodes full context through attention mechanisms.

Training data construction requires careful consideration of class imbalance. Correct predictions typically outnumber incorrect ones 90:10 or more, necessitating weighted loss functions, oversampling minority classes, or evaluation metrics robust to imbalance like AUROC and Precision-Recall AUC. Post-hoc calibration via temperature scaling can reduce ECE by 50%+ with minimal computational cost—simply rescaling logits by an optimized temperature parameter found via validation set tuning. This technique complements probe-based methods, often applied as a final calibration step.

## State-of-the-art: CCPS and perturbation-based stability

The most significant recent advance emerged in 2025 with CCPS (Calibrating LLM Confidence by Probing Perturbed Representation Stability). The core innovation applies adversarial perturbations to final hidden states, then extracts features measuring representational stability under targeted perturbations. Specifically, CCPS perturbs along the gradient direction of token log-probability with respect to hidden state, exploring perturbation trajectories with magnitude ε ∈ [0, 0.1].

The method extracts **500+ dimensional feature vectors** per token, including original state features (entropy, top-k logits, prediction margins), perturbation features (epsilon-to-flip thresholds, Prediction Entropy Impact values), and comparison features (KL/JS divergence, cosine similarity between perturbed and original distributions). A lightweight classifier—only **9,542 parameters for multiple-choice tasks**—trained on these features achieves remarkable performance: **55% average ECE reduction**, **up to 88% in best configurations**, and **6 percentage point AUROC improvements** (up to 17pp on some benchmarks).

CCPS's significance extends beyond raw performance numbers. It establishes that internal representational stability provides stronger uncertainty signals than external consistency checking (generating multiple outputs and measuring agreement). The method works as a white-box approach, requiring model access but not modifying weights or generation procedures. Computational overhead remains modest—perturbation and feature extraction add less than 1ms per prediction on modern GPUs.

## Semantic uncertainty and hallucination detection at scale

Semantic entropy, introduced by Lorenz Kuhn, Yarin Gal, and Sebastian Farquhar in their 2023 ICLR spotlight paper, addresses a fundamental limitation of token-level uncertainty: different token sequences can express identical meanings. The method generates multiple completions, clusters semantically equivalent responses using entailment checking or sentence embeddings, then computes entropy over semantic clusters rather than raw sequences. This simple shift—moving from sequence-level to meaning-level uncertainty—dramatically improves correlation with model accuracy.

The approach scaled to production in their 2024 Nature paper "Detecting Hallucinations in Large Language Models Using Semantic Entropy," achieving **strong performance on AUROC and AURAC metrics** across diverse datasets without task-specific tuning. For long-form text, the method decomposes outputs into factoids, generates questions per factoid, and computes semantic entropy per claim. This granular approach enables claim-level uncertainty estimation, critical for applications like medical QA where partial hallucinations (correct context but fabricated details) pose serious risks.

Complementary detection methods leverage internal states directly. The "Internal State of an LLM Knows When It's Lying" work from EMNLP 2023 demonstrates that activations contain exploitable truthfulness signals. LLM-Check achieves **45x-450x speedups** over baseline methods through eigenvalue analysis of internal representations, attention kernel maps, and output token uncertainty quantification. These efficiency gains enable real-time hallucination detection in production systems, where millisecond latencies matter.

## Epistemic versus aleatoric: Decomposing uncertainty sources

Theoretical foundations distinguish two fundamental uncertainty types. Aleatoric uncertainty stems from irreducible randomness in the data-generating process—asking "What will this coin flip show?" has inherent uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty arises from knowledge gaps—"What is the capital of Obscuristan?" could be answered with sufficient information. This distinction, rigorously formalized in Hüllermeier and Waegeman's 2021 Machine Learning paper, proves practically valuable for LLM deployment: epistemic uncertainty suggests model improvement needs, while aleatoric uncertainty indicates query refinement requirements.

Recent work demonstrates that **linear probes trained on LLM activations achieve high accuracy classifying epistemic versus aleatoric uncertainties**, with probes trained on Wikipedia generalizing effectively to code data (Harvard Kempner Institute findings). The NAACL 2024 paper "Decomposing Uncertainty for LLMs through Input Clarification Ensembling" introduces a practical framework: generate clarifications for ambiguous inputs, ensemble predictions under different clarifications, then factor total uncertainty into aleatoric (from input ambiguity) and epistemic (from missing knowledge) components.

However, emerging theoretical work questions whether this dichotomy represents fundamental categories or exists on a continuum. The ICLR 2025 blog post "Reexamining the Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty Dichotomy" argues definitions directly contradict each other and proposes viewing uncertainty through tasks and sources rather than strict types. For LLMs handling ambiguous queries in complex domains, multiple uncertainty sources interact, suggesting that flexible decomposition frameworks outperform rigid categorization.

## Datasets and benchmarks: Standardized evaluation protocols

MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) has emerged as the essential benchmark, offering **15,908 questions across 57 tasks** spanning humanities, social sciences, STEM, and professional domains. Its comprehensive coverage enables evaluating calibration consistency across knowledge domains—critical since models often show domain-specific miscalibration. MMLU-Pro extends difficulty with 10 answer choices instead of 4, providing finer-grained uncertainty assessment for advanced models approaching saturation on standard MMLU.

For open-domain question answering, TriviaQA and Natural Questions provide complementary evaluation. TriviaQA's **650,000 question-answer-evidence triples** from trivia websites test factual knowledge confidence across diverse topics, while Natural Questions' **323,000 real Google search queries** with Wikipedia answers capture real-world query distributions. Both support extractive QA (confidence in extracted spans) and generative QA (confidence in generated answers), enabling evaluation across task formulations.

Specialized benchmarks address domain-specific and reasoning requirements. GSM8K's **8,500 grade-school math problems** test confidence in multi-step reasoning with verifiable ground truth. TruthfulQA's 817 questions across 38 categories specifically probe truthfulness versus hallucination in potentially misleading contexts—essential for safety-critical applications. MedQA provides high-stakes domain testing with medical exam questions averaging 916 characters, substantially longer and more complex than general benchmarks. An effective evaluation suite combines MMLU for breadth, TriviaQA for factual depth, GSM8K for reasoning, and TruthfulQA for safety assessment.

## Open-source models: Practical research platforms

Llama models from Meta represent the gold standard for academic research. Llama 3.1 offers sizes from **8B to 405B parameters**, with the 70B variant providing optimal performance-accessibility balance for most research. The series benefits from comprehensive documentation, extensive community support, wide adoption in published work enabling direct comparison, and full white-box access to activations through HuggingFace Transformers. Hardware requirements scale from 14GB VRAM for the 7B model (consumer GPU accessible) to 140GB for 70B (requiring multi-GPU setups or cloud infrastructure).

Mistral models excel at efficiency. The 7B base model achieves performance comparable to much larger models through architectural optimizations and high-quality training data. The 8x7B Mixture-of-Experts variant activates only ~12B parameters per token while matching 70B+ model performance on many benchmarks. Apache 2.0 licensing provides maximum flexibility for commercial applications and research dissemination. For resource-constrained research or edge deployment studies, Mistral offers the best performance-per-compute ratio currently available.

Qwen 2.5 from Alibaba provides the strongest multilingual capabilities, supporting **29+ languages** with sizes from 0.5B to 72B parameters. The series shows particular strength in coding and reasoning tasks, with specialized variants (Qwen2.5-Coder, Qwen2.5-Math) optimized for specific domains. For multilingual confidence studies or international application research, Qwen's cross-lingual consistency makes it the optimal choice. The smaller models (1.5B-3B) enable rapid prototyping on consumer hardware while larger models (32B-72B) provide competitive performance with leading closed-source systems.

## Code repositories: Production-ready implementations

The factual-confidence-of-llms repository from Amazon Science provides the most production-ready implementation, offering five distinct confidence estimation methods: verbalized (prompt-based), trained probes, surrogate token probability, average sequence probability, and model consistency. The codebase includes a paraphrasing pipeline with semantic preservation checks—critical for consistency-based methods—and comprehensive documentation enabling rapid deployment. Poetry-based dependency management ensures reproducible environments across development and production.

For academic research, the llm-uncertainty repository accompanying "Can LLMs Express Their Uncertainty?" (ICLR 2024) establishes benchmarking standards. It implements multiple prompting strategies (vanilla, chain-of-thought, self-probing, multi-step), sampling methods with temperature control, and consistency-based aggregation techniques across GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and TriviaQA. Experiments cover GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Vicuna, and LLaMA 2, providing reproducible baselines for comparing novel methods.

LLaMA-Factory deserves special mention for fine-tuning and adapter training. Supporting **100+ LLMs** (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, etc.) with LoRA, QLoRA, and full fine-tuning methods, it provides a web UI (LlamaBoard) enabling one-click training workflows. For probe development requiring fine-tuned models or adapter-based confidence estimators, LLaMA-Factory dramatically reduces engineering overhead. The repository maintains **35,000+ GitHub stars** with active daily development, indicating strong community support and rapid bug resolution.

## Novel directions: Multi-scale hierarchical probing

Current methods predominantly probe single layers in isolation, yet uncertainty likely manifests across multiple scales and architectural components. A breakthrough opportunity exists in developing hierarchical multi-scale probing architectures that integrate uncertainty signals from token-level (local uncertainty at each position), span-level (phrase/sentence uncertainty), semantic-level (concept/fact uncertainty), and global levels (overall response confidence). An attention mechanism could learn optimal aggregation weights, with different scales emphasized for different query types—syntactic questions might weight token-level signals heavily while factual queries prioritize semantic-level features.

The technical implementation would extract features from multiple layers (early, middle, late) representing different abstraction levels. Multi-head attention over layer × scale representations would enable learning complex interactions—for instance, high token-level uncertainty in early layers combined with stable semantic representations in middle layers might indicate lexical ambiguity without conceptual confusion. Joint training with a hierarchical loss function (separate objectives per scale, plus global confidence objective) would encourage learning scale-appropriate features while maintaining end-to-end optimization.

This approach addresses a critical gap: explaining where uncertainty originates. Current methods provide scalar confidence scores without decomposition. Hierarchical probing could output structured uncertainty—"high confidence in main claim, moderate uncertainty in supporting details, low confidence in specific numbers"—enabling more nuanced decision-making in downstream applications.

## Mechanistic interpretability meets uncertainty: Sparse autoencoders for confidence

Anthropic's recent work on sparse autoencoders (SAEs) extracted millions of interpretable features from Claude Sonnet, demonstrating that models represent concepts in superposition—many features encoded in fewer dimensions. Gemma Scope from DeepMind released open-source SAEs for Gemma models with interactive exploration via Neuronpedia. However, connection to uncertainty quantification remains minimal. A transformative research direction involves training uncertainty-aware sparse autoencoders that jointly optimize reconstruction quality and uncertainty prediction.

Standard SAEs minimize reconstruction error while enforcing sparsity: **L = ||x - f(e(x))||² + λ||e(x)||₁** where e encodes and f decodes. The uncertainty-aware variant adds a term: **L = ||x - f(e(x))||² + λ||e(x)||₁ + α·confidence_loss(e(x), y)** where confidence_loss measures how well the sparse encoding predicts correctness. Regularization could further encourage features correlated with uncertainty, creating "uncertainty features" as first-class citizens in the learned representation.

The expected benefits extend beyond performance. Current probe features (raw activations or their statistics) lack interpretability—we know probes work but not why. Uncertainty-aware SAE features would be interpretable by construction, each corresponding to human-understandable concepts. Explanations could take the form: "Low confidence due to weak activation of [country capital] feature and high activation of [similar sounding name] feature." This represents a fundamental shift from black-box uncertainty scores to mechanistically grounded, interpretable confidence estimates.

## Causal circuits for confidence: Tracing uncertainty through transformers

Mechanistic interpretability research identifies circuits—specific combinations of attention heads and MLP layers implementing algorithms. The "How Transformers Solve Propositional Logic Problems" paper uses activation patching to trace information flow through reasoning circuits. Applying these techniques to uncertainty estimation could identify dedicated "confidence circuits" in LLMs. Key research questions include: Do such circuits exist? How do they interact with task-specific circuits? Can we manipulate confidence through surgical interventions?

The methodology would combine sparse autoencoders (identifying candidate uncertainty features), causal tracing (tracking their propagation through layers via activation patching), and comprehensive ablation studies (validating feature importance). Building circuit diagrams for confidence computation would provide the first mechanistic understanding of how LLMs internally assess their own reliability. Early evidence suggests promise: different attention heads show specialized functions, residual stream analysis reveals direct information propagation pathways, and layer-wise probing demonstrates that uncertainty representations build progressively through depth.

Practical applications could follow quickly. If specific heads or neuron clusters primarily compute confidence, we could train smaller models optimized for uncertainty estimation by distilling only those components. Adversarial robustness could improve by monitoring circuit activations—detecting when confidence circuits behave anomalously relative to normal operation. Most ambitiously, real-time confidence steering during generation could prevent hallucinations by amplifying uncertainty signals before the model commits to dubious claims.

## The VLM challenge: Multi-modal uncertainty quantification

Vision-language models like LLaVA, GPT-4V, and Gemini represent a critical frontier where uncertainty quantification research lags substantially. Preliminary work indicates these models show significant miscalibration, with verbalized uncertainty remaining "insufficiently studied" according to recent surveys. A systematic research program should develop modality-specific probes (visual encoder, language decoder), cross-modal probes (vision-language interaction layers), and alignment probes (measuring vision-text agreement).

Novel experimental protocols could perturb visual features while measuring language confidence changes, identifying "cross-modal uncertainty propagation" patterns. For instance, does corrupting high-level visual features (object categories) impact confidence more than low-level features (edges, textures)? Do models know when to trust vision versus language—can they detect when visual input contradicts textual priors? These questions lack systematic investigation but prove essential for deploying VLMs in robotics, medical imaging, and autonomous systems where multi-modal fusion directly impacts safety.

Technical implementation faces challenges absent in pure language models: visual representations vary significantly across architectures (patch embeddings, grid features, object tokens), cross-attention mechanisms differ in design, and evaluating visual uncertainty requires vision-specific benchmarks. However, recent VLM releases provide necessary infrastructure—open-source models like LLaVA and InstructBLIP offer full activation access, while benchmarks like VQAv2 and multi-modal reasoning datasets enable standardized evaluation.

## Temporal dynamics: Uncertainty evolution during generation

Most current methods treat generation statically—assessing confidence post-hoc after complete outputs. Yet uncertainty clearly evolves during generation: early tokens set context, middle tokens develop arguments, final tokens commit to specific claims. Token-level uncertainty dynamics remain understudied despite obvious relevance for applications like early stopping (halting generation when uncertainty spikes) and dynamic sampling (adjusting temperature based on real-time confidence).

The "forking paths analysis" concept tracks how alternative generation trajectories diverge at high-uncertainty decision points. Implementing this requires extracting hidden states at each generation step, training probes for token-level confidence, and analyzing how errors at uncertain positions propagate to subsequent tokens. Causal tracing experiments could patch activations at critical junctures, measuring effects on downstream uncertainty and final answer correctness.

Sequential probing architectures offer technical solutions. An LSTM or Transformer encoder could process hidden states across generation steps, capturing temporal dependencies in uncertainty evolution. This enables answering questions like: Do models become progressively more confident or uncertain during generation? Are there critical "commitment points" where uncertainty sharply decreases? Can we predict hallucinations before they occur by detecting anomalous uncertainty trajectories? Positive answers would enable proactive interventions—pausing generation for human review, triggering retrieval augmentation, or resampling with modified prompts.

## Training objectives beyond supervision: Contrastive and meta-learning

Current probes predominantly use standard supervised learning with cross-entropy loss. Unexplored training objectives could improve calibration and generalization. Contrastive uncertainty learning applies SimCLR-style frameworks where correct+confident predictions, correct+uncertain predictions, incorrect+confident predictions, and incorrect+uncertain predictions form natural contrastive sets. The objective learns representations where uncertainty becomes linearly separable, potentially improving robustness to distribution shift and label noise.

Meta-learning for uncertainty estimation trains probes to rapidly adapt to new domains with minimal data. The core idea: learn a probe initialization that fine-tunes effectively on target domains with just 100-1000 examples. This addresses a practical deployment challenge—production systems encounter novel domains (new medical specialties, emerging legal precedents, recent scientific discoveries) where recalibration data is scarce. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Prototypical Networks adapted for uncertainty estimation could provide solutions.

Multi-objective optimization balancing calibration, discrimination, and computational efficiency represents another frontier. Standard approaches optimize a single metric (typically classification accuracy), with calibration addressed post-hoc. Joint optimization with Pareto-aware methods could find better trade-offs—achieving 90% of peak discrimination with 10x lower computational cost and superior calibration. Recent work in Bayesian optimization and neural architecture search provides methodological foundations applicable to probe architecture design.

## Cross-architecture generalization: Universal uncertainty representations

Research predominantly trains probes on single model architectures, yet practical systems might need confidence estimates across multiple models—for instance, routing queries between Llama and Mistral based on predicted performance. Preliminary evidence suggests different model families encode uncertainty differently: Gemma shows more "uncertainty neurons" (activations highly correlated with correctness) than LLaMA, and transfer learning across architectures shows substantial performance degradation.

The fundamental research question asks: Do universal uncertainty representations exist that transfer across architectures? This connects to broader questions in representation learning about whether semantic knowledge is architecture-invariant. Potential approaches include training on diverse model families simultaneously, using domain adaptation techniques (gradient reversal layers making probes architecture-agnostic), or identifying canonical uncertainty features present across all transformers (attention entropy, layer-wise gradient norms, activation magnitudes in specific layers).

Success would enable powerful applications: training a single high-quality probe on a large accessible model (Llama 3.1 70B) then deploying to smaller specialized models without retraining, combining uncertainty estimates from multiple models for ensemble confidence, and understanding fundamental properties of uncertainty representations in neural networks beyond LLMs specifically.

## Research roadmap for MIT: Phased approach to breakthrough contributions

A strategic 18-month research program should progress through three phases. **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)** establishes foundations: implement and benchmark existing methods (CCPS, semantic entropy, consistency-based approaches), conduct systematic layer and architecture analysis across Llama, Mistral, and Qwen, and build robust evaluation infrastructure supporting automated benchmarking on MMLU, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA.

**Phase 2 (Months 4-9)** pursues innovation: develop hierarchical multi-scale probing integrating token, span, semantic, and global uncertainty signals; implement uncertainty-aware sparse autoencoders with joint reconstruction and confidence objectives; extend methods to VLMs with modality-specific and cross-modal probing; explore causal probing through activation patching and ablation studies.

**Phase 3 (Months 10-18)** targets breakthrough contributions: identify and map uncertainty circuits using full mechanistic interpretability toolkit; develop theoretical framework explaining when and why probes succeed; create production-ready open-source library with efficient implementations; demonstrate novel applications (real-time confidence steering, claim-level uncertainty for long-form generation, cross-modal confidence fusion).

Expected deliverables include 3-4 papers targeting top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL/EMNLP), an open-source toolkit with comprehensive documentation, potential industry collaborations (Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI), and theoretical insights advancing fundamental understanding of uncertainty in neural networks.

## Conclusion: Convergence creates breakthrough opportunity

The field sits at an exceptional juncture where three trends converge. First, mechanistic interpretability has matured from speculative investigation to precise circuit identification, providing tools for understanding rather than merely measuring uncertainty. Second, practical deployment demands for safe AI create urgent need for reliable confidence estimates, with industries from healthcare to finance requiring calibrated uncertainty for regulatory compliance. Third, open-source infrastructure (models, benchmarks, codebases) has reached critical mass where ambitious research programs can prototype rapidly and validate rigorously.

The MIT project should capitalize on this convergence by pursuing integration over incremental improvement. Rather than achieving a few percentage points better calibration on established benchmarks, target mechanistic understanding of how LLMs represent and compute uncertainty internally. This requires combining tools from probing, sparse autoencoders, causal tracing, and circuit analysis into unified frameworks. Success would transcend current methods' limitations—moving from correlational black-box confidence scores to causal mechanistic models enabling principled interventions.

The highest-impact contribution would establish that transformers implement interpretable uncertainty circuits—specific computational pathways that assess confidence separately from generating outputs. This would parallel discoveries in vision models where specific neurons detect edges, textures, and objects. For LLMs, evidence suggests specialized representations for knowledge versus confidence exist; proving this conclusively and mapping the full computational graph would represent a fundamental advance in AI safety and interpretability. The research program outlined provides a concrete path from current state-of-the-art toward this transformative goal.
